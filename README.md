# MouseEVK
USB HID mouse device on a EVK1105, running on a 32UC3A0512 chip, using a tft screen, analog to digital converter, touch sensitive buttons, usb port, sd card reader, on board leds, an external analog multiplexer, flexor sensors and a 3 axis accelerometer IMU. This implementation is the culmination of the Embedded Systems for Telecommunications course taught by Dr. Alfredo Mantilla

This project uses the following subjects seen in both the classroom and the laboratory: GPIO, LCD screen, external interrupts,USART, SPI, FAT, ADC, SDMMC and FreeRTOS.
